        Vino el apagón, ¡ay dios! (Hold up, wait, hold up, wait!) (Oh, no!)
        
        [USNAVI, BENNY, ENSEMBLE]
        Yo! I! Can’t see! (Nina, where'd you go?) (Oh, no!)
        Quit shovin’ you son of a— (I can't find you) (Oh, no!)
        It’s an oven and we gotta back out (Nina, take it slow, I'm behind you) (Oh, no!)

        Calling all ​taxis! (What's going on, what's going on?) (Oh, no!)
        
        [KEVIN/USNAVI, SONNY, MEN]
        Everyone ​relax ​please (Suddenly I find the electricity is gone) (Oh, no!)</p>

            [KEVIN/USNAVI, SONNY, MEN]
            Everyone ​relax ​please (I gotta guard the store, make sure that nothing's going wrong) (Oh, no!)
            
            [BENNY, SONNY, ENSEMBLE]
            Somebody better open these goddamn doors! (What's going on, what's going on?) (Oh, no!)

            Somebody better open these goddamn doors! (Gotta find Usnavi, tell him what is going on) (Oh, no!)
            
            [BENNY, SONNY, ENSEMBLE]
            Somebody better open these goddamn doors! (Nothing is on, nothing is on) (Oh, no!)
            
            [VANESSA/SONNY, ENSEMBLE]
            And I can’t find Usnavi (No! No! No!)

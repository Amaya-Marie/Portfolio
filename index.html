        Everyone ​relax ​please (I gotta guard the store, make sure that nothing's going wrong) (Oh, no!)
        
        [BENNY, SONNY, ENSEMBLE]
        Somebody better open these goddamn doors! (What's going on, what's going on?) (Oh, no!)
        
        [VANESSA, SONNY, ENSEMBLE]
        Somebody better open these goddamn doors! (Gotta find Usnavi, tell him what is going on) (Oh, no!)
        
        [BENNY, SONNY, ENSEMBLE]
        Somebody better open these goddamn doors! (Nothing is on, nothing is on) (Oh, no!)
        
        [VANESSA/SONNY, ENSEMBLE]
        And I can’t find Usnavi (No! No! No!)

        [KEVIN, VANESSA]
        Please find Nina!
        Find Camila! (Find my way home)
        If you see my family
        Bring them home! (Usnavi, help me!)
        
        [SONNY, VANESSA]
        We are powerless
        We are powerless (You left me alone!)
        
        [SONNY/CAMILA/PIRAGUA GUY/ENSEMBLE]
        We are powerless, we are powerless
        
        [GRAFFITI PETE]
        Yo! Yo! They throwin’ bottles in the street
        People lootin’ and shootin’
        Sonny, they wanna see a robbery
        We gotta keep movin’</p>
    <p>[SONNY]
        Naw, man, I can’t leave, we gotta guard the store!
        
        [GRAFFITI PETE]
        They gonna bombard the store
        Until you ain’t got a store no more!
        
        [SONNY]
        I got a baseball bat on a rack in the back
        
        [GRAFFITI PETE]
        I got a couple Roman candles
        We can distract the vandals
        
        [SONNY]
        Hey, yo, I see some thugs comin’
        Man, we gonna get jacked up
        
        [GRAFFITI PETE]
        Gimme a light, I’ll be right back. Back up—
        
        [GRAFFITI PETE/SONNY]
        Back up! Back up!
        
        [An explosion is heard as fireworks are set off.]
        
        [COMPANY]
        Look at the fireworks, look at the fireworks fly
        Light up the night sky, light up the night sky
        Look at the fireworks, look at the fireworks fly
        Light up the night sky, light up the night sky
        
        [SONNY]
        It’s late and this grate won’t come down, come down!
        
        [SONNY, CARLA]
        It’s late and this grate (Oh God, so much panic!)
        Won’t come down! (The crowd was manic)
        
        [SONNY/TWO MEN, CARLA, DANIELA]
        We are ​powerless (With everybody screaming and shoving and shouting and slapping) (Mira, mi amor, házme un favor)
        We are ​powerless (And everyone's franctic! What's happening with you?) (Despiértale abuela y a lo mejor ella tiene una vela)
        
        [SONNY/CARLA/PIRAGUA GUY/MEN, DANIELA]
        We are powerless (Estuve bailando cuando vino el apagón)
        
        [SONNY/CARLA/PIRAGUA GUY/VANESSA/ENSEMBLE, DANIELA]
        We are powerless (Aquí hay gente)
